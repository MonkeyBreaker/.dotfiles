# Personal dotfiles folder

This repository contains the dotfiles I created/updated over time.
It's personal work/preferences, take want you want but I'm not resposible if something break :smile:

I currently have the dotfiles for:

* vim
* tmux

The docs folder contains information about the pluggins use and their mappings. Be careful, It could happen that the docs are not up-to-date !

I do it in my spare time to manage this. Most of the time is when I encounter an issue/missing feature/etc. that I update the dotfiles.
